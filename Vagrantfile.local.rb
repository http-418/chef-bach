#
# This file is intended to be included in another Vagrantfile.  It
# copies local SSL CAs from the host to the new guest VM, and injects
# any HTTP proxy settings from the enclosing environments into the
# /etc/environment file.
#
# The canonical path for locally installed CAs on Linux is
# /usr/local/share/ca-certificates.  This path is shared from the host
# to the guest using the vboxsf driver, then the guest updates its CAs
# using the host's local certificates.
#
# If $http_proxy or $https_proxy is set when Vagrant is invoked, this
# file's provisioners will copy those settings into /etc/environment.
